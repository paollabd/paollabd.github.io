        <p class="a">SPOILER ALERT! Spoilers do not spoil a movie</p>
        <p>
            A friend once asked me if I had seen Star Wars and she was shocked to find out that I had not. She demanded that I sat down in front of the television immediately and said “Luke I am your father! I cannot believe you’ve never heard that before!” To that I said, “Of course I‘ve heard that! That’s why I haven’t watched it! I already know the ending, where’s the fun in that?”. After she explained to me that Star Wars consisted of six movies (at the time) and that knowing that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker’s father only gave away the plot of one of the movies, she convinced me to watch the entire series. Back then I believed that finding out the ending of a movie was the entire point of watching it. If that was spoiled, the movie was not worth seeing. However, after learning about the different elements that motion pictures consist of, I have come to realize that movies are much more than their endings and they continue to be just as magical even if you can quote the movie word by word. <br>
            What is magical about movies is the idea that you are looking at something that both looks and feels real. Looking at a movie screen we see a world that seems identical to ours. Compelled by sounds, colors, movements, and objects, it is very hard to notice that everything we see and hear is there for a reason: make the audience feel something. In real life we do not know what is going to happen. Knowing the ending of a movie makes them seem less vivid and turns them into several minutes of footage that you have to go through just to see something you already know is going to happen. At least, that is what I used to think. Even though the magic of film is their ability to make viewers place themselves in the story and make them believe that everything is unfolding right before their eyes, placing oneself outside the scenes can bring about a stronger appreciation for film, making them magical in ways one might not have realized otherwise.
            Take the movie V for Vendetta, for example. The beginning of the movie consists of a monologue by the character Evey (Natalie Portman). Upon first watching this movie a few years ago, I didn’t give this scene much thought, but after learning about the different types of narratives in films and watching V for Vendetta for the second time, I came to realize that Evey's monologue is a crucial component of the film since it indicates not only indicates that the entire movie is a flashback, placing it in the past, but it also that the whole movie is told from her perspective. Without giving it much regard, my mind was already being set to “Remember, remember the 5th of November”. <br>
             Even though it is easy to be drawn into the story and experience it along with the characters, placing the movie in the past might make the audience feel a little less involved in the narrative. However, in some ways the audience might feel more connected to it since there is more room for interpretation and gives the audience more room to question the movie.
            One thing that viewers can question is the main message of the movie. I understood this message to be that people can be held accountable for tyranny in the government. Even though I agree with this message, it is possible to argue that this is not a universally held belief. People are bias and as the saying goes: “Every story has two sides”. One could argue that it is impossible to unite everyone to fight for the same cause because people are often selfish and value privilege over common good. Viewers could also question the positive image left of V at the end of the movie. Evey believes that V represents an idea: the idea revolution and freedom, but if people are bias, so is Evey. People are raised under certain customs and beliefs and Evey is no different.<br>
            Throughout the movie we learn that Evey’s family died fighting for the same cause V was fighting for, thus her past has led her to embrace V's cause and throughout the movie hints are given to us that this is the case. In one of the first scenes of the movie Evey is getting ready to meet someone and as she is getting dressed the TV was on. Commander Prothero is giving a speech and as she is listening to it, her actions are compared to V’s actions as the frames switch from V to Evey showing the audience that they have similar habits even though they do not know each other. Both of them are listening to the speech while getting ready in front of a mirror. The camera films through the eyes of V's mask and heads towards the mirror. The camera then passes sideways through the mirror and Evey shows up sitting by her vanity putting red lipstick on. The frame then switches to a full shot of the room facing her vanity, showing the wide wall she is sitting by and how little the mirror she is using is. Towards the end of the scene Evey turns the TV off saying “That’s quite enough of that, thank you very much” with a sarcastic tone in her voice. Maybe she already disliked the government even before she met V, which would explain why she is so captivated by him. After that, there is a shot of her feet heading to the right side of the screen and the frame switches to his feet heading left, which was a subtle way of indicating that the characters would soon meet.
            Evey first meets V when he saves Evey from being raped by the government’s agents when she leaves her home after curfew. However, in order to protect her V murdered the men who put her in danger without a single moment of hesitation. V then invites her to a concerto, which turned out to be an attack targeting. Even after this event, Evey still seems to feel empathy towards the masked man and continues to help him in an almost instinctive manner. Throughout the whole course of the movie V is portrayed an indestructible being. During Evey’s beginning monologue, she proclaims that “Ideas do not bleed”, which then leads viewers to conform with the fact that V, with whom she is so infatuated by, is somehow beyond human or maybe even not human at all. V survives all sorts of extreme situations that a regular human being would never be able to, however he still dies at the end. That’s right, no spoiler warning. V dies. But no need to be alarmed, he is fully aware of his fate. In fact, if I had payed more attention to Evey’s ever-so-subtle monologue, perhaps I would have know that from the beginning. But even throughout his death scene V seems indestructible. He survives being shot by government agents. Evey tries to stop the bleeding, but certain about his doom, V says “Please don’t. I’m finished and glad of it”. This is a critical point in the movie because since the beginning, ideas were presented as bulletproof. V represented the idea of revolution and freedom, and he seemed to be almost indestructible, but he was shown to be human after all. So how bulletproof can ideas be?
            This led me to think of why V was killed in the movie at all. He could have been portrayed as an idea that lives on despite all circumstances and the most unlikely turn of events, but instead he is shown to be human after all. One could then question if ideas are really bulletproof. What makes me believe that they really are is the fact that the idea of revolution and freedom does not die with V. It lives on. Even though the mask represents the idea, it is not the idea itself. Ideas lie within people. All of this can be interpreted by simply taking the movie literally, but since the magic of the movies is the ability to make everything seem real we can dive into the movie and analyze it further. <br>
            Maybe V did in fact die after being shot and his survival is her imagination turning V into a hero. Moreover, maybe the whole movie is not only intended for us in the real world, but for the people within the movie - a biography of V created with the intent of persuading people to unite under the same cause. It serves the population of the film just as the biography of Valerie, which she found written in toilet paper in her sell, served her during while she was held captive. It inspired her to let go of her fears and fight for what she thought was right. Interpreting the movie as Evey’s point of view creates a story within a story. It builds layers that intertwine fact and fiction. <br>
            The same way part of Star Wars was spoiled to me before I got the chance to watch any of the movies, I have spoiled the ending of V for Vendetta for those who have not watched it before reading this essay. My intent is to show you how much can be taken from a movie despite knowing how the narrative goes. Such realizations would not have been possible for me to make without knowledge of what movies consist of, which is why I did not make these connections the first time I watched V for Vendetta. Watching this movie a third time, I was most of the time aware of where the cameras were places, and if I wasn’t, I was trying to figure out where they were. Being aware of the cameras, lights, microphones, or maybe even green screens that were on set can make the experience less vivid, but not less meaningful. Spoilers do not ruin a movie for me anymore; they open doors for me to live it differently. <br>

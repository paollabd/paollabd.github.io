  <h3>All About Mama</h3>


  <div id = "text">
    <!-- PARAGRAPH -->
    <p>Cooking Mama's Bistro opened in 2013, along with the release of the Nintendo DS game Cooking Mama 5. Mama is known for her hands-on teaching method and easy-to-follow recipes. After the original Cooking Mama was released, Mama became instantly famous. She shared both her recipes and her passion for home-cooked meals with thousands of children around the globe. However, three Cooking Mama's later, Mama was tired of cooking. No one heard from Mama for years, until one day Mama was found gardening vegetables in her backyard. According to Mama's mama, Mama spent those years travelling around the world learning different gardening techniques. Those travels taught her a lot about food <span>sourcing</span> and sustainability, making Mama excited about cooking again. Hence Mama's decision to both release Cooking Mama 5 and open her own Bistro, which only serves meals prepared with locally sourced ingredients.</p>

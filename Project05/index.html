        <h2>Paw Air</h2>
        <p>Goal: Develop the design concept for a fictional company.</p>
        <p>PawAir is the first airline for pets only. PawAir's mission is to guarantee that every pet has a safe and calm flight. Many airlines require animals to travel along with dispatched luggage or even demand that they are drugged so that other passengers aren't disturbed. PawAir is concearned with the well being and health of every animal and ensures a stress-free flight for each pet and a life-changing experience for every owner.</p>

          <h3>Physical Application of the Logo</h3>
          <p>The final part of the project was to create a physical application of the logo. Since my company is a pet airline, I thougth the company could benefit from each pet having it's own colar with a tag as an airline ticket.</p>
          <img src="PhyApp/collar.png" alt="Project 1" width="15%">
          <p>First step was to photoshop some versions of the tags on the "pets".</p>
          <img src="PhyApp/pet1.png" alt="Project 1" width="20%">
          <img src="PhyApp/pet2.png" alt="Project 1" width="35%">
          <p>Second step was to prototype on InDesign what the tag would actually look like.</p>
          <img src="PhyApp/draft1.png" alt="Project 1" width="25%">
          <img src="PhyApp/draft2.png" alt="Project 1" width="25%">
          <img src="PhyApp/draft3.png" alt="Project 1" width="15%">
          <p>The last step was to start laser cutting and test out different materials. At first, I tried laser cutting acrilic. It ended up being way too fragile and ealisy broke. My alternative was to order stainless steal tags and test that out. It ended up workign out perfectly and it only took me a couple of times to center the logo and QR code.</p>
